# The yml build definition is the "roadmap" for a build, that tells DrupalCI what steps to execute, in what order, and
# Provides a way to "lock" configuration values.
# The structure of a build.yml will always follow the following conventions:
# There are five levels:
# 1. The build
# 2. Build stages and build level configuration.
# 3. Build phases and build stage configuration.
# 4. Build steps and Build phase configuration.
# 5. Build step configuration.


# The keys at each level are one of two possibilities: either the plugin name for a buildstage/job/buildtask,
# *or* they are a configuration override that will take precedence over all other configuration directives.
# The default build.yml file may contain keys who's default configuration is a no-op.
# this is to allow for those configurations to be overridden, such as composer, and patches.

# If any build task is an indexed array, and not a keyed array, the assumption is that we want to
# run that build task multiple times, with different configuration overrides each time

# The build level really only exists to provide for a possibility to run entire, multiple builds. It might go away.
